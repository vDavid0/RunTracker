# Introduction

This app is designed to track data about trainings. Such as distance covered, duration, maximum speed attained, variance in altitude, and the precise trajectory traversed.

# Structure of the Application

It consists of two main tabs, each containing additional views that provide easy navigation.

- ***New Training***

- ***History***

## New Training

When the application is opened, a screen will appear where users can start a new training session.

 Once the "Start training" button is pressed, the application will begin collecting data on the user's running activity and display their live location.

*As a side note, please be aware that the measurements for meters, steps, and altitude difference will all display as zero during the demo photos as I am using the simulator.*

## History

Within this tab, users have the ability to access and review their past training sessions.
