# Introduction

Deciding what to have for lunch or dinner and managing leftover ingredients can often be a challenging puzzle in many households.

Recognizing these common dilemmas, I have designed and developed an application that aims to provide a solution.

Its purpose is to not only help users find creative culinary inspiration but also foster a sense of community by allowing them to share and draw inspiration from other people's recipes.
 
Through a modern and entertaining approach, this application aims to simplify the process and make cooking an enjoyable experience for everyone.

# Structure of the Application

It consists of three main tabs, each containing additional views that provide easy navigation.

- ***Home*** (description, uploader's profile)

- ***Scanning*** (image recognition / manual)

- ***Profile*** (profile, add recipe)

***

## Home

When opening the application, a stack of random recipe videos appear one after the other. Users can browse through these videos to find ideas. It is also possible to navigate to the uploader's profile for similar content.

Each video includes a detailed description of the recipe.

## Scanning

The purpose of this tab is to allow the user to specify the desired videos to be displayed based on their preferences. This can be done by providing the ingredients.

There are two ways to do this:

- One solution is image recognition, where the user can scan the desired ingredients using the phone's camera. The software then uses image recognition to identify the specific ingredient.

- The other solution is to select the ingredients from a searchable list.

## Profile

On this tab a specific user's profile can be viewed. 

Clicking on a video will display a stack of videos, which are uploaded by the user.

This tab is also used to upload recipes.
